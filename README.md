I'm a Product, Project and Process Manager.

I work as Product Manager at [Orbe Soft](https://orbesoft.com.br/), analyzing and managing end-to-end products/projects, with the main objective of understanding the pain and need of the customer, proposing the best solution for it, ensuring a quality delivery, maintaining the communication from start to finish, always thinking about usability and end-user experience.

In addition, support in the implementation of standard documentation, tools, flows and processes for the continuous improvement of the work environment.

I also do some work such as QA (Quality Assurance) and UX (User Experience), both in the projects I manage and as an individual consultancy for these two services.

My focus is on the Products area, therefore, my studies in the field are constant, always focusing on continuous improvement, so that I can become a specialist in the area as a Product Manager.I work as Product Manager at Orbe Soft, analyzing and managing end-to-end products/projects, with the main objective of understanding the pain and need of the customer, proposing the best solution for it, ensuring a quality delivery, maintaining the communication from start to finish, always thinking about usability and end-user experience.
