I work in the management and analysis of products, understanding customer needs and seeking efficient solutions to enhance the user journey and experience.

Currently, I hold the position of Business Analyst at [DOT Digital Group]([url](https://dotgroup.com.br/)), a company focused on Learning Management System (LMS) solutions for the agribusiness sector. In this role, I lead the creation of learning and training platforms, both corporate and institutional.

My background includes technical experience, having started my career as a developer and worked closely with engineering and development teams. I have knowledge in programming languages such as SQL, Java, Javascript, NodeJS, and React, and have contributed to the implementation of documentation, tools, and processes for continuous product improvement.

Over 5 years, I have been involved in 56 IT projects, spanning various areas such as B2C and B2B digital platforms, mobile (iOS and Android), SaaS, e-commerce, the financial market, and customized software for companies of different sizes.

My skills include team management, product development, project management, customer support (CS), customer experience (CX), user experience (UX), quality assurance (QA), and the application of agile frameworks such as Scrum and Kanban. As a crucial part of my role, I maintain constant communication, manage the roadmap, and remove impediments to ensure quality delivery.
